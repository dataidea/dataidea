    "a) NumPy  \n",
    "b) Pandas  \n",
    "c) Scikit-learn  \n",
    "d) Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the purpose of rescaling data before applying machine learning algorithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "a) To speed up the training process  \n",
    "b) To make the data visually appealing  \n",
    "c) To ensure that all features contribute equally to the model  \n",
    "d) To reduce overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Which of the following statements about Min-Max Scaling is true?\n",
    "\n",
    "a) It preserves the mean and standard deviation of the original data.  \n",
    "b) It is not suitable for data with outliers.  \n",
    "c) It transforms data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.  \n",
    "d) It scales data to a specified range, typically between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What does the Min-Max Scaling formula look like for rescaling a feature `x` to the range `[a, b]`?\n",
    "\n",
    "a) `x_prime = (x - np.mean(x)) / np.std(x)`  \n",
    "b) `x_prime = (x - np.min(x)) / (np.max(x) - np.min(x)) * (b - a) + a`  \n",

    "8. When should you use Standardization over Min-Max Scaling?\n",
    "\n",
    "a) When the data has a clear minimum and maximum value.  \n",
    "b) When the distribution of the data is not Gaussian (normal).  \n",
    "c) When preserving the relationships between data points is important.  \n",
    "d) When the data contains outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Which Python library provides the `MinMaxScaler` and `StandardScaler` classes for rescaling data?\n",
