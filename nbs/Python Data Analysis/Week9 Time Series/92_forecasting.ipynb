    "Forecasting refers to the future predictions based on the time series data analysis. Below are the steps performed during time series forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Understand the time series characteristics like trend, seasonality etc\n",
    "* Step 2: Do the analysis and identify the best method to make the time series stationary\n",
    "* Step 3: Note down the transformation steps performed to make the time series stationary and make sure that the reverse transformation of data is possible to get the original scale back\n",
    "* Step 4: Based on data analysis choose the appropriate model for time series forecasting\n",
    "* Step 5: We can assess the performance of a model by applying simple metrics such as residual sum of squares(RSS). Make sure to use whole data for prediction.\n",
    "* Step 6: Now we will have an array of predictions which are in transformed scale. We just need to apply the reverse transformation to get the prediction values in original scale.\n",
    "* Step 7: At the end we can do the future forecasting and get the future forecasted values in original scale."
